Okay, we're in the home stretch. Here are some design constraints and notes.

* We're going, at the last minute, to go for a vertical setup. It consumes
  less table space, is easy to do, and will make for a sturdier frame.
* Do we want to use aluminum, wood, or steel for the frame? We want something
  strong enough, easy to attach to, that can be supported properly. Default
  is aluminum: light, etc.
* Inner shell: cork for sound absorbtion, baffles+fan for cooling. Pull air
  in through the bottom, pass it out through the top.
* Outer shell: wood is nice, easy to build, heavy; fiberglass is a pain to
  make but nice; thermoforming a shell?
  * Wood: painted or stained?
  * Plastic: Rep1 style? Thermoformed? Cut panels? Acrylic: too brittle.
    HDPE: very bendy. ABS? can't laser but strong. Poly? Delrin?

* Design files should all be in solvespace. Needed parts:
  * Monitor driver PCB
  * Monitor
  * Power conditioning board
  * Rough box for BBB/adapter
